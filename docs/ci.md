# Continuous Integration

This documents the CI pipeline added in Phase 1 / Milestone 2 of `plan.md`
(`specs/phase-1/milestone-2-ci-pipeline/`): the four required checks, static analysis, dependency updates, and
every repository setting that isn't a file in this repo.

## Checks

| Check (job) | What it runs | Local equivalent | Timeout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `typecheck` | `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit` in every package and in `scripts/`) | `pnpm typecheck` | 10 min |
| `lint` | `pnpm lint` (ESLint in every package and in `scripts/`, then the [license check](#license-check)), then the [lockfile-format guard](#lockfile-format) | `pnpm lint` | 10 min |
| `test` | `pnpm test` (Vitest in every package and in `scripts/`; a `globalSetup` migrates the database and seeds the admin user) against a real `postgres:16-alpine` service container, then `pnpm build`, the built-output check (`pnpm --filter @specter/web verify:build`: no inline script or style, no `data:` URIs), and the Playwright browser tests against the built app (`pnpm test:e2e`, Chromium) | `docker compose up -d db && pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm --filter @specter/web verify:build && pnpm test:e2e` (once: `pnpm --filter @specter/web exec playwright install chromium`) | 25 min |
| `docker-build` | `docker build --pull .` (never pushed anywhere) | `docker build .` | 15 min |

All four run on every pull request to `main`, on every push to `main`, and on demand
(`workflow_dispatch`). They're defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; the Node/pnpm setup steps
shared across `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` and the `audit` job live in
`.github/actions/setup-workspace`.

Two other workflows run but are **not required checks**:

| Workflow (job) | Trigger | Blocks merging? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CodeQL (`analyze`) | PR, push to `main`, weekly, on demand | No — see [CodeQL](#codeql) |
| Audit (`audit`) | Daily, on demand | No — see [Audit](#audit) |

## Running checks locally

```sh
corepack enable            # gives you the exact pnpm version CI uses (packageManager)
docker compose up -d db    # only the database
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env.test  # once; then edit it, as described below
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
docker build .
```

`pnpm test` and `pnpm test:e2e` read a gitignored `.env.test` at the repository root. CI supplies
the same values as job variables instead, so it needs no such file. After `cp .env.example
.env.test`, set `DB_PASSWORD=devpassword` (the database password in `docker-compose.yml`) and
replace the other `change-me` values with local-only values, for example
`JWT_SECRET=local-only-not-a-secret` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`. `DB_HOST=localhost` is already
right. Never commit the file.

`pnpm test` migrates the database and seeds the admin user itself (via a Vitest `globalSetup`),
so this works against a freshly created database volume — you don't need to have run the full
app first.

`packages/db`'s tests also drop and recreate a database called `specter_db_test`, and create and
drop short-lived `specter_upgrade_*` databases, on that same server. They need a role that can
create databases: the `postgres` user in `docker-compose.yml` and in the CI service container can.
Don't point `DB_HOST` at a server that holds anything that matters.

## Merge gate

`main` only accepts pull requests: direct pushes, force pushes and branch deletion are rejected.
A pull request cannot merge unless `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` and `docker-build` have all passed
on its latest commit. **Nobody can bypass this, including repository admins** — there are no
bypass actors on the ruleset.

- **Ruleset ID**: `24080645` (`shivamsaraswat/specter`, target `main`).
- **Definition**: `.github/rulesets/main.json`. This is the file to recreate the ruleset from if
  it's ever deleted:

  ```sh
  gh api -X POST repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/rulesets --input .github/rulesets/main.json
  ```

- **Emergency path**: if the hosting platform itself is down and no check can report at all, the
  only way through the gate is to temporarily disable the ruleset, then restore it:

  ```sh
  # Disable (emergency only):
  gh api -X PUT repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/rulesets/24080645 \
    --input <(gh api repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/rulesets/24080645 | jq '.enforcement = "disabled"')

  # Restore once the merge has gone through:
  gh api -X PUT repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/rulesets/24080645 \
    --input <(gh api repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/rulesets/24080645 | jq '.enforcement = "active"')
  ```

  A normal broken check (a bug in the pipeline itself, a pinned action failing) does **not**
  qualify for this — fix it with a pull request like any other change, which runs its own,
  corrected version of the checks.

## Repository settings with no file equivalent

These aren't in any committed file — they're applied directly against the GitHub API. Each
command below both documents and recreates the setting.

| Setting | Value | Recreate with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merge-gate ruleset | Active, id `24080645`, no bypass actors | see [Merge gate](#merge-gate) above |
| Dependabot alerts | Enabled | `gh api -X PUT repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/vulnerability-alerts` |
| Dependabot security updates | Enabled | `gh api -X PUT repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/automated-security-fixes` |
| CodeQL default setup | Disabled (the advanced-setup `codeql.yml` runs instead) | `gh api -X PATCH repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/code-scanning/default-setup -f state=not-configured` |
| Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions | Read-only; cannot approve PRs | `gh api -X PUT repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/actions/permissions/workflow -f default_workflow_permissions=read -F can_approve_pull_request_reviews=false` |
| Fork PR workflow approval | `first_time_contributors` (GitHub's default) | left as-is; verify with `gh api repos/shivamsaraswat/specter/actions/permissions/fork-pr-contributor-approval` |

**Scheduled workflows note**: GitHub disables scheduled workflows on public repositories after
60 days with no repository activity. If the weekly CodeQL run or the daily audit run stops firing,
re-enable it from the Actions tab.

## License check

The `lint` job also fails when a dependency that ships in the product has a license that is not on
the allowed list (Phase 1 / Milestone 7, `specs/phase-1/milestone-7-open-source-hygiene/`). It runs as the last
step of `pnpm lint`, so a local `pnpm lint` and the CI job behave identically.

- **What it checks**: the production npm dependencies of every workspace package, as
  `pnpm licenses list --prod --json` reports them. These are the ones deployed with the API or
  bundled into the web app. Development-only dependencies are not checked, and neither are the
  container base image's operating-system packages.
- **The policy** is `scripts/license-policy.json`: `allowed`, a list of SPDX license ids (MIT, ISC,
  BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0, 0BSD), and `exceptions`, a map from package name to the
  reason it is exempt. The check is default-deny. A license that is missing, unknown, written as
  free text or uses `WITH` fails, and so does an exception for a package that no longer ships.
  `(MIT OR GPL-3.0-only)` passes, because one alternative is allowed.
- **Adding an exception** is a reviewed change to that file. Verify the dependency's real license
  by hand, and put that license and the reason in the entry. Changing `allowed` is reviewed the same
  way, with the reason in the pull request.
- **Exit codes**: `0` all allowed, `1` at least one violation (one line each), `2` the check could
  not run, for example when `pnpm licenses` fails or the policy is malformed. It never counts as a
  pass.
- **No network access**: it reads the installed package manifests only.
- **Third-party notices**: the web build also writes `apps/web/dist/.vite/license.md`, with the
  license text of every bundled dependency, because the minified bundle keeps no license comments.
  The image carries it, it is not served, and `pnpm --filter @specter/web verify:build` checks it.

## Lockfile format

`pnpm-lock.yaml` must be a single YAML document — no line matching `^---`. The `lint` check fails
the build if it ever isn't.

**Why**: pnpm ≥ 11 writes `pnpm-lock.yaml` as *two* concatenated YAML documents when it manages
its own version (an "env" document with `packageManagerDependencies`, followed by the real
lockfile). GitHub's dependency graph parser reads only the first document, so it reports **zero
dependencies** for the whole workspace and silently disables Dependabot alerts and security
updates ([dependabot-core#15904](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/15904),
open with no fix scheduled as of this writing).

**The trade-off**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `pmOnFail: ignore`, which is the only value that
makes pnpm write a single document. The cost is that pnpm no longer checks the running pnpm
version against `packageManager` itself. This is compensated for:

- CI and the Docker build both install the exact pinned version via Corepack
  (`pnpm/action-setup` reads `packageManager`; the Dockerfile runs `corepack enable`).
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` still fails on any lockfile/manifest drift.
- Contributors are told to run `corepack enable` (see the top-level README).

**Revert this** once dependabot-core#15904 ships: remove `pmOnFail: ignore` from
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, remove the `lint` job's lockfile-format guard step in `ci.yml`, and let
pnpm regenerate the lockfile normally.

## Dependabot

Weekly (Monday), grouped per ecosystem for minor/patch updates. Every ecosystem has a 3-day
cooldown on new releases (`cooldown.default-days: 3`):

- **npm** (`/`) — the cooldown exceeds pnpm's own 24-hour `minimumReleaseAge` protection.
  - **Known limitation**: the cooldown only covers *direct* dependencies. A Dependabot PR can
    still fail with `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION` if a *transitive* dependency was
    published in the last 24 hours. If that happens, comment `@dependabot recreate` on the PR the
    next day.
- **docker** (`/`) — the base image is pinned as `node:22-alpine@sha256:<digest>`, so weekly runs
  propose digest refreshes (patch releases, security rebuilds of the same tag). Node major-version
  bumps are ignored deliberately — moving to a new Node major is a human decision, and CI follows
  it automatically once the Dockerfile changes.
- **github-actions** (`/` and `/.github/actions/*`) — keeps the pinned commit SHAs (and their
  `# vX.Y.Z` comments) in `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `audit.yml` and the composite action current.

Updates that fix a published security advisory are proposed immediately, individually, without
waiting for the weekly schedule or the cooldown. No proposal is auto-merged — a maintainer reviews
and merges each one once its checks pass.

## CodeQL

Advanced setup (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`), analyzing `javascript-typescript` and `actions`
(the workflow files themselves), with the broadest built-in query suite: `security-and-quality`
(`security-extended` plus code-quality queries). Runs on PRs, on pushes to `main`, weekly, and on
demand.

Findings are **informational** — they show up on the pull request and under Security → Code
scanning, but never block a merge on their own. The first run under the broadened suite may
surface a number of existing quality findings; that's expected, and the backlog is worked down
over time rather than blocking anything.

Dismissing a finding as a false positive or "won't fix" needs a written reason in the dismissal.

## Audit

`.github/workflows/audit.yml` is a second, independent source of dependency advisories, since the
lockfile-format fix above is a workaround for an open upstream bug. It runs daily and on demand,
never on pull requests, and is never a required check.

It runs two steps:

1. `pnpm audit` — prints the full report at every severity. Marked `continue-on-error: true`, so
   this step never fails the job by itself.
2. `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` — the actual gate. Fails the job only on **high or critical**
   advisories. (`--audit-level` filters what gets *printed*, not just the exit code, which is why
   this needs two separate steps rather than one.)

A failed scheduled run notifies maintainers through GitHub's standard workflow-failure email.
