Sync Impact Report
==================
Version change: 1.7.0 → 1.8.0
Rationale: Phase 2 Milestone 3 (the rule engine, specs/phase-2/milestone-3-rule-engine/) adds an entry point to
  /api/v1, POST /api/v1/threat-models/{id}/threats/generate, which runs the shipped threat library against a
  threat model's diagram and writes the threats and mitigations it proposes, and it is the first server-side
  writer of `origin = 'rule'`. It adds a column (`threats.stale`) that only that writer sets, and it makes a
  rule-generated threat's element and rule permanent in the database. Principle V requires the Threat Model
  section to be updated for a new entry point in the same change. This is a MINOR: it adds to the Threat Model
  section's entry points and mitigations, as Phase 1 Milestones 5 and 6 and Phase 2 Milestone 1 did, and adds or
  changes no principle.
Modified principles: none (Principle V's rule is applied, not changed)
Added sections: none (existing section set retained: Core Principles, Threat Model (STRIDE),
  Development Workflow & Quality Gates, Governance)
Removed sections: none
Threat Model changes:
  - Trust boundaries (current): the generate endpoint is named among the /api/v1 entry points; it is in the same
    trust tier as the single-record threat endpoints.
  - Tampering: Mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 3): a rule-generated threat is written only by the rule engine; its
    element and rule cannot change (`threats_rule_link_immutable`), there is at most one per element and rule
    (`threats_rule_key`), and `stale` sits outside every client schema. The earlier line "Only server-side writers
    may record those, and none exist before Phase 2" is replaced.
  - Repudiation: Partially mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 3): a generation run writes one stdout line with the
    account, the threat model and the counts.
  - Denial of Service: Partially mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 3): one run is bounded by the 1,000-element limit and
    the shipped library, and holds the threat model's lock while it runs, so element writes to that model queue
    behind it.
  - Elevation of Privilege: no widening. Any authenticated account could already create threats and mitigations by
    hand; generation creates only what the shipped, reviewed rules describe.
Deferred / TODO items: none
Templates requiring follow-up: none checked in this run (scope of this change is the constitution
  file only; dependent templates read it at runtime per the scope guard)

# Specter Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Secure Coding by Default (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All database access MUST use parameterized queries or a typed query builder (Kysely for the
threat-model tables behind `/api/v1`, since Phase 1 Milestone 5; plain `pg` with parameterized SQL
for login, users, admin seeding, browser sessions and sign-in throttling) — string-concatenated or
template-interpolated SQL is forbidden everywhere: values are always parameters. The one exception
is an SQL identifier (a table, column or database name), which cannot be a parameter. It may be
built into a statement only if it is a constant or comes from a fixed allow-list, and it MUST be
passed through the driver's identifier escaping (`pg.escapeIdentifier`, or the query builder's
equivalent); an identifier derived from request input is never allowed. All request input (body, params, query)
MUST be validated at the boundary before use — reject unknown shapes, enforce type/length/enum
constraints (via the shared zod schemas in `packages/core` for `/api/v1`; inline in
`apps/api/src/routes/login.ts`, `session.ts` and `users.ts`) rather than trusting the client.
Passwords MUST be hashed with bcrypt (or an equivalent memory-hard algorithm) at cost factor
≥ 10 and MUST NEVER be logged, returned in API responses, or stored in plaintext. Authentication
comparisons that branch on "does this identity exist" (e.g. login) MUST use a constant-time or
dummy-hash strategy to avoid user-enumeration timing leaks, per the existing `DUMMY_HASH`
pattern in `apps/api/src/auth.ts`. Secrets — `JWT_SECRET`, DB credentials, admin credentials, and, from
Phase 3 onward, LLM provider API keys — MUST be sourced from environment variables or a secrets
manager, MUST NEVER be committed to the repository, logged, stored in plaintext in the database,
or sent to the browser, and the process MUST refuse to start if a required secret is missing.
Session credentials and the browser UI's access tokens are credentials too: only a digest of a
session credential is ever stored, neither is logged or put in a URL, and the access token is held
in page memory only, never in browser storage.
Every non-public route MUST sit behind an authentication check (or an equivalent, explicitly
reviewed mechanism) — there is no default-allow. That includes the OpenAPI document served under
`/api/v1`. `/api/users` accepts only an `/api/login` bearer token. `/api/v1` also accepts a browser
UI's access token, checked against its still-active session on every request. The `/api/session`
endpoints are authenticated by the session cookie, which is the reviewed mechanism: `SameSite=Strict`,
scoped to that path, with an Origin check and a JSON content type on every request
(`apps/api/src/session/cookie.ts`).
**Rationale**: Specter stores STRIDE threat data and, later, an organization's design
documents and code context; a security lapse in the tool that tracks threats undermines its own
purpose. Non-negotiable because these are the few rules that, if violated, turn a code review
comment into a breach.

### II. Test-First Development
New behavior (routes, auth logic, validation, config loading, rule/threat-generation logic)
MUST have an automated test that fails before the change and passes after, following the
existing pattern in `test/config.test.js`. Bug fixes MUST first add a test that reproduces the
defect. The test suite (`npm test` today; `pnpm test` / Vitest, plus Playwright for key UI
flows, from Phase 1's monorepo scaffold onward per plan.md) MUST pass before a change is
considered complete. A change that cannot be tested without a live Postgres instance MUST
isolate the untestable part (e.g. via an injectable client, as `config.load()` already does)
rather than being left untested. Every PR MUST pass typecheck, lint, test (against a real
Postgres service container; this check also builds the app and runs the Playwright browser tests
against it, since Phase 1 Milestone 6), and Docker build — these are enforced by a branch ruleset on `main`
with no bypass actors, including for repository admins (`.github/rulesets/main.json`; see
`docs/ci.md`); Dependabot and CodeQL (query suite `security-and-quality`) MUST stay enabled and
remain informational/non-blocking in this milestone. Once any LLM-backed feature exists (Phase
3+), a change to a prompt, provider
adapter, or extraction/threat-generation pipeline MUST pass the eval harness (`pnpm eval`)
against its committed thresholds (starting point per plan.md: ≥70% threat recall, 100%
schema-valid output after retries, 100% valid citations) before merge. Tests assert observable
behavior (status codes, response shape, persisted rows, eval metrics) — not implementation
details.
**Rationale**: The project's own test suite is currently thin (one file); growing it test-first
keeps coverage honest as the app grows from a single Express service into a monorepo with an
AI pipeline, where regressions are far more expensive to find by hand.

### III. Code Quality & Simplicity
Modules stay small and single-purpose (one route file per resource, one concern per function),
matching `apps/api/src/v1/` and `apps/api/src/routes/` (one file per resource) and the target layout in
plan.md (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/worker`, `packages/core`, `packages/db`,
`packages/threat-library`, `packages/llm`). From Phase 1 onward all code MUST be strict-mode
TypeScript; a bare `any` requires an inline justification. Do not introduce an abstraction,
configuration option, dependency, or a later phase's feature while an earlier phase is in
progress — plan.md is phased deliberately, and each phase MUST stay YAGNI relative to the
phases after it (e.g. no RBAC scaffolding while Phase 1–5 are in flight; no agentic tool-calling
while Phase 3 explicitly excludes it). Error responses MUST use a consistent `{ error: string }`
JSON shape and appropriate HTTP status codes. No dead code, no commented-out blocks, no unused
dependencies — delete rather than comment out.
**Rationale**: Simplicity is an explicit product goal (plan.md guiding principle: "small,
shippable phases... keep it YAGNI inside each phase"); building ahead of the current phase is
exactly the complexity creep plan.md is structured to prevent.

### IV. Maintainability & Observability
Configuration MUST come only from environment variables or a secrets-manager path (`apps/api/src/config.ts`
today) — never from local config files read at runtime. Logs MUST go to stdout/stderr only (no
file-based logging), and MUST NOT contain secrets, password hashes, full JWTs, or raw LLM
provider payloads (prompt/response logging is opt-in and off by default, per plan.md's AI
security hardening). Schema changes MUST be forward-only SQL files, tracked via the existing
`schema_migrations` mechanism (Kysely is used for queries only; migrations stay plain SQL files) — never edited in
place once merged. Every environment variable the app reads MUST be documented in `README.md`'s
environment variable table. Per plan.md's cloud-friendly rules: `/health` MUST return 200 with
no auth and no DB dependency; the API and worker processes MUST remain stateless and
horizontally scalable; uploaded/ingested files MUST go through a storage abstraction (local
volume or S3-compatible), never an absolute local path. Threat-library rules, detection
heuristics, and LLM prompts MUST be stored as versioned data files in the repo (e.g.
`packages/threat-library`, a `prompts/` tree) rather than hardcoded inline, so they are
readable, diffable, and reviewable without reading application code.
**Rationale**: The app is deployed via env-var-only configuration to multiple environments
today, and plan.md commits to keeping every future phase self-hostable and horizontally
scalable; undocumented config, hidden file paths, or logic buried in code instead of data files
break that portability and make both incidents and prompt changes harder to review.

### V. Least-Privilege, Threat-Aware Design
Every new feature or endpoint MUST be checked against the Threat Model section below before
merge, and that section MUST be updated in the same change if the feature adds an asset, an
entry point, or crosses a new trust boundary — this applies in full to phase boundaries in
plan.md (e.g. Phase 3's document ingestion and LLM egress, Phase 4's repository/IaC access,
Phase 5's third-party integrations). New privileged operations (creating users, deleting data,
changing auth, connecting an external system) MUST default to the least-privileged design
available; a broader grant is permitted only when explicitly justified in the PR description.
The app currently has no role separation, and that gap is a known, tracked risk scheduled to
close with RBAC/SSO/audit logging in Phase 6 (see Threat Model) — until then, broadening what an
authenticated user can do MUST still be called out explicitly, not treated as free.
**Rationale**: A threat-tracking app is a natural target and a credibility risk if it is itself
insecure (plan.md guiding principle: "secure by default, and dogfooded — Specter keeps its own
threat model, built in Specter"); treating the threat model as a living document keeps security
review proportional to what actually changed, phase over phase.

### VI. AI Output Is a Draft With Provenance, Never Silent
From the moment any LLM-backed feature exists (Phase 3 onward): every AI-proposed element,
threat, or mitigation MUST carry its rationale and a citation to the source text, chunk, or code
it came from. Nothing AI-generated MUST enter the threat model without an explicit human accept
action — draft and accepted state are always distinguishable in the data model (`origin`:
`manual` / `rule` / `ai`). LLM structured output MUST be validated against its zod schema before
it is written to the database; output that fails validation MUST be retried or rejected, never
persisted as-is. Uploaded or ingested documents (and, from Phase 4, repository/IaC content) MUST
be treated as untrusted input: clearly delimited in prompts, never executed, and never allowed
to trigger a tool call or an autonomous action on their own — Phase 3 and Phase 4 are explicitly
scoped to exclude agentic tool-calling. AI-generated text MUST be rendered escaped in the UI. The
LLM provider integration MUST stay behind Specter's own provider-agnostic interface
(`packages/llm`) — no feature may hard-depend on one vendor's API, and a fully local model
(e.g. Ollama/vLLM) MUST remain a supported path. When a non-local, hosted provider is configured,
the UI MUST clearly disclose that data leaves the install.
**Rationale**: This is Specter's core trust proposition (plan.md guiding principles: "AI output
is a draft with provenance... nothing AI-generated enters the threat model silently", "private
by default", "provider-agnostic LLM layer") — without it, an AI-assisted threat model is not
more trustworthy than an unreviewed guess, and self-hosters lose the reason to choose Specter
over a vendor-locked competitor.

## Threat Model (STRIDE)

This section reflects the application as implemented today (Node.js/Express 5 API with a versioned
JSON API under `/api/v1`, browser sessions under `/api/session`, the React web app it serves,
PostgreSQL, optional AWS Secrets Manager) and MUST be kept current per
Principle V as each phase in plan.md lands. Phase boundaries that will change this section are
called out inline below; they are not yet implemented and MUST NOT be treated as mitigated until
they ship.

**Assets (current)**: user credentials (`users.password_hash`); the JWT signing secret; database
credentials; issued JWTs (bearer tokens) held by clients; the CI/CD pipeline's own integrity — the
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, third-party GitHub Actions steps, the base and service container images it pulls
(Phase 1 Milestone 2, `specs/phase-1/milestone-2-ci-pipeline/`), and, since Phase 1 Milestone 6, the Playwright browser
binaries and system packages the `test` job downloads; threat-model records — projects, threat models,
elements, threats and mitigations (Phase 1 Milestone 3, `specs/phase-1/milestone-3-domain-schema/`), stored in the
database and, since Phase 1 Milestone 5 (`specs/phase-1/milestone-5-rest-api-v1/`), readable and writable by any
authenticated account through `/api/v1`; browser sessions (`browser_sessions`, Phase 1 Milestone 6,
`specs/phase-1/milestone-6-react-app-shell/`), whose session credentials are stored only as SHA-256 digests, the
short-lived access tokens the UI holds in page memory, and the sign-in failure counts
(`sign_in_throttle`), whose keys are HMACs of what was typed and of the client address. The original
threat entry records and Milestone 4's legacy links no longer exist: Milestone 5 removed them.
**Assets (planned, not yet implemented)**: from Phase 3 — uploaded design documents, extracted
text chunks and embeddings, LLM provider API keys, and the LLM outputs derived from them; from
Phase 4 — read-only repository/IaC access tokens and cloned source code; from Phase 5 —
third-party OAuth tokens (Jira, Confluence, Google Docs, Linear, Azure DevOps) and outbound
webhook targets.

**Trust boundaries (current)**: Internet → load balancer/reverse proxy → Express app
(`apps/api/src/app.ts`) → PostgreSQL (`apps/api/src/db.ts`); API clients → JSON API (`/api/login`,
`/api/session`, `/api/users` and `/api/v1`, with its OpenAPI document; since Phase 2 Milestone 1 `/api/v1`
includes `POST /api/v1/threat-models/{id}/elements/batch`, which writes up to 200 elements in one request, and since Phase 2 Milestone 3 `POST /api/v1/threat-models/{id}/threats/generate`, which creates the threats and mitigations the shipped rules propose for a diagram),
where everything but login and
session sign-in sits behind authentication: a bearer token for `/api/users` and `/api/v1`, the session
cookie for the rest of `/api/session`. Since Phase 1 Milestone 6 the same app also serves the web app
the browser loads (`apps/api/src/web.ts`, with a strict CSP), so a browser → UI boundary exists, and
the UI's own scripts run inside the user's authenticated session. The
app itself has a single trust tier: any holder of a valid JWT is fully trusted. Since Phase 1
Milestone 2, a CI/CD boundary also exists: GitHub Actions workflows — including on pull requests
from forks — run against this repository's contents with a scoped, read-by-default
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, and pull third-party actions and container images from outside the repository.
**Trust boundaries (planned)**: Phase 3 adds an outbound boundary from the worker process to a
third-party LLM provider (or a local model, which stays inside the trust boundary) and an inbound
boundary for untrusted document content flowing into prompts (prompt-injection surface — see
Principle VI). Phase 4 adds a boundary into external source-control/IaC systems (read-only,
code never executed). Phase 5 adds boundaries into external SaaS integrations and inbound
webhooks.

- **Spoofing**: Sign-in (`POST /api/login` and `POST /api/session`) is unauthenticated by design.
  *Mitigated*: username enumeration via response timing is defended with a dummy bcrypt comparison
  (`apps/api/src/auth.ts:DUMMY_HASH`), and throttling behaves the same whether or not the username
  exists. *Mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 6)*: failed sign-ins are throttled per username-and-address and
  per address (`apps/api/src/session/throttle.ts`), with no per-account lockout, so an attacker
  cannot lock the admin out; an IPv6 address counts as its /64; the counted address is the socket
  address unless `TRUST_PROXY` names a trusted proxy. Session theft is mitigated: the long-lived
  credential is an HttpOnly cookie that scripts cannot read, it rotates on every renewal, and
  replaying a replaced credential after a 30-second grace window ends the session (and is logged as
  reuse). *Residual risks*: a thief who replays a just-replaced credential inside the grace window
  gets one 5-minute access token and no new credential; guessing spread across many addresses or many
  /64s is slowed per address but not stopped; `/api/login` bearer tokens are not revoked by sign out
  everywhere and live until they expire; a credential more than one rotation old matches nothing and
  is answered 401 without triggering reuse detection, because only the previous credential is stored
  (the holder gains nothing, so no token-family table is kept). *Planned*: from
  Phase 3, indirect prompt injection from an ingested document could attempt to "spoof"
  instructions to the LLM (e.g. impersonate the system prompt); Principle VI's untrusted-input
  handling is the primary mitigation and MUST be verified before Phase 3 ships.
- **Tampering**: All SQL is parameterized or built with Kysely (`apps/api/src/v1/`,
  `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts`, `apps/api/src/auth.ts`) — no injection path found. Request bodies
  are size-capped at 100kb (`apps/api/src/app.ts`). CSRF: `/api/v1` and `/api/users` authorize only by a credential the client sends explicitly,
  never by a cookie, so no cross-site request can ride a session there. The one cookie
  (`specter_session`) reaches only `/api/session`, is `SameSite=Strict`, and those endpoints also
  require an Origin matching the request's host (Express's `req.host`, which honours
  `X-Forwarded-Host` only from a trusted proxy) and a JSON content type, which forces a CORS
  preflight the app never answers. *Planned*: from Phase 3, AI-proposed edits are a new
  tampering-like surface if they could reach the model without review; mitigated by Principle
  VI's mandatory human-accept step. *Mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 1)*: an element's `properties` and
  `layout` are validated against a fixed vocabulary on every write (tags up to 20, 50 characters each;
  flags that belong to the element's type; positions in a fixed range; no other keys), by one schema in
  `packages/core` that the single-record endpoints and the batch endpoint share, and a batch is
  applied in one transaction, so a refused operation leaves nothing half-written. The editor draws
  every element name and tag as text, never as markup, under the same strict CSP.
  *Accepted risk (Phase 1 Milestone 6)*: the required `test` job downloads Playwright's browser
  binaries and system packages from outside the repository, pinned only by the lockfile's
  `@playwright/test` version, which Dependabot's cooldown and pnpm's `minimumReleaseAge` cover.
  *Mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 2)*: every third-party GitHub
  Actions step is pinned to a full commit SHA, not a movable tag; the Docker base image and the
  CI database's service-container image are pinned by digest; Dependabot's npm updates carry a
  2-day cooldown on top of pnpm's own `minimumReleaseAge`; and a required `lint`-check step fails
  the build if `pnpm-lock.yaml` ever reverts to the multi-document format described below.
  *Accepted risk*: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `pmOnFail: ignore` so the lockfile stays a single
  YAML document — required because GitHub's dependency graph misreads pnpm's two-document format
  as zero dependencies, silently disabling Dependabot alerts
  ([dependabot-core#15904](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/15904)). The cost
  is that pnpm no longer verifies the running pnpm version against `packageManager` itself;
  Corepack and CI's own pinned install compensate. Revert once #15904 ships. *Mitigated (Phase 1
  Milestone 3)*: the database itself enforces the integrity of threat-model records, so no writer
  — the API, the rule engine, AI drafts — can store a structurally inconsistent model: references
  stay inside one threat model, data-flow endpoints and boundary parents have the right element
  types, trust boundaries stay acyclic, an element with threats cannot be deleted from under
  them, `risk` is derived and cannot be set, and `origin` has no default and cannot change after
  creation, so a rule- or AI-generated threat can neither be stored labelled as manual nor be
  relabelled later. *Mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 5)*: a threat created through `/api/v1` is always
  `origin = 'manual'`: a request for `rule` or `ai` is rejected, and `origin` cannot be changed, so
  a client cannot fake rule or AI provenance (Principle VI). Only server-side writers may record
  those. *Mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 3)*: the rule engine (`apps/api/src/rule-engine/`) is the only
  writer of `origin = 'rule'`. A generated threat's `element_id` and `library_ref` cannot change, whoever
  asks, and an unchanged value is not a change (`threats_rule_link_immutable`, in the database, answered
  `400` through `/api/v1`), so a client can neither re-point it nor fake which rule produced it. There is at
  most one generated threat per element and rule (`threats_rule_key`), a generated threat must name both
  (`threats_rule_link`), and `stale`, the marker that a generated threat no longer fits the diagram, is set
  only by the engine, only on generated threats (`threats_stale_rule_only`), and is outside every client
  schema. A run is one transaction under the threat model's lock, so a failure leaves nothing half-written.
  Milestone 4's legacy-link protection is retired with the
  links: Milestone 5 removed the imported data, the link table and the legacy entry table.
- **Repudiation**: *Open risk*: no audit trail persists who created, updated, or deleted a
  threat-model record or a user — the JWT's `sub` is known per-request but never written to storage.
  This is a notable gap precisely because Repudiation is one of the STRIDE categories the app
  itself is meant to help track. *Planned*: plan.md Phase 6 closes this gap with a persisted
  audit log of who changed what; until Phase 6 ships, this remains an accepted, tracked risk.
  *Partially mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 5)*: every successful `/api/v1` create, update and
  delete writes one stdout line with the account id, action, record type and record id, never field
  values, so an operator has a trace. It is not persisted or tamper-evident, so the risk stays open
  until Phase 6's audit log. *Partially mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 6)*: every sign-in, failed
  sign-in, throttled sign-in, logout, sign out everywhere and session end writes one stdout line with
  ids and an event name only, never a username, password, credential, token or client address.
  *Partially mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 3)*: every generation run writes one stdout line with the
  account id, the threat model id and the counts of what it created and flagged, never a name or a threat's
  text; the threats and mitigations it creates get no line each.
- **Information Disclosure**: Generic 500s are returned to clients while details are logged
  server-side only (`apps/api/src/app.ts` error handler); `x-powered-by` is disabled. Secrets are never
  read from committed files (`.env` is gitignored) and can be sourced from AWS Secrets Manager.
  *Mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 6)*: every response carries a strict Content-Security-Policy
  (own origin only, no inline code, no framing) and hardening headers
  (`apps/api/src/security-headers.ts`), brought forward from Phase 6; the UI renders all record text
  as text; and an injected script can no longer read a long-lived credential. Zod runs `jitless`
  (`apps/web/src/zod-config.ts`, which must stay the first import of the entry point), because its
  `new Function` probe would otherwise be reported as a CSP violation. *Planned*: from Phase 3, a hosted (non-local) LLM provider is itself a
  disclosure path for any data included in a prompt — Principle VI requires the UI to disclose
  this, and a fully local model MUST remain available for installs that cannot accept it.
  *Mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 2)*: no CI job references a repository secret; the `test` job's
  credentials are throwaway, non-secret development defaults defined directly in the workflow, so
  pull requests from forks get identical, fully-functional results with nothing to leak. Every
  job triggers on `pull_request`, never `pull_request_target`, and every checkout sets
  `persist-credentials: false`. *Mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 5)*:
  `/api/v1` errors are fixed messages that never echo a submitted or stored value or the database
  driver's message and detail, and the write log carries ids only. Deleting the legacy data also
  removes it for good: an entry deleted on purpose can no longer reappear through a new endpoint.
- **Denial of Service**: JSON payloads are capped at 100kb; the `/api/v1` lists are not
  paginated, so a list returns every matching record (low risk at current expected scale, and
  specs/phase-1/milestone-5-rest-api-v1 SC-007 measures a threat model of 1,000 threats and 2,000 mitigations). *Partially mitigated (Phase 1 Milestone 6)*: failed sign-ins are throttled per address, never per
  account, so the throttle cannot be used to lock a user out; behind a load balancer `TRUST_PROXY`
  must be set, or every client shares the balancer's address and the per-address limit applies to
  everyone at once. *Partially mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 1)*: a threat model holds at most 1,000
  elements, enforced by a database trigger that every writer passes through, and a batch carries at most 200
  operations, so a single request cannot make an unbounded write; the model lock a write takes
  (`FOR NO KEY UPDATE` on the threat model row) queues writers to one model without blocking reads or other
  models. *Partially mitigated (Phase 2 Milestone 3)*: one generation run is bounded by the
  1,000-element limit times the shipped library's per-element maximum (today up to 15 threats and 49
  mitigations for one element), so about 15,000 threats and 49,000 mitigations, written in chunked
  statements inside one transaction (measured at about a second). It holds the threat model's lock for its duration, so element
  writes to that model, and other runs on it, queue behind it. *Open risk*: no rate limiting on any other route. *Planned*: Phase 6 adds general
  rate limiting explicitly; from Phase 3, LLM calls
  MUST carry per-job token/cost caps (plan.md Phase 3 Milestone 2) so a single job cannot
  exhaust provider budget or worker capacity.
- **Elevation of Privilege**: *Open risk, by design, currently unmitigated*: there is no role
  model. Any authenticated user can create additional users (`POST /api/users`) and, since Phase 1
  Milestone 5, can read, change and delete every project, threat model, element, threat and
  mitigation through `/api/v1`, including deleting a project with everything inside it. That
  widening was called out in Milestone 5's spec and PR, and is accepted until Phase 6. The browser UI's
  access token does not widen it: it is limited to `/api/v1` (`requireV1Token`), so a script injected
  into the page cannot create accounts through `/api/users` (`requireApiToken`). If `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` are unset, no user is
  seeded and the app is unusable (fails closed, not open). *Planned*: plan.md Phase 6 introduces
  RBAC (viewer/contributor/reviewer/admin) and OIDC/SAML SSO to close this gap; until Phase 6
  ships, any change that widens what a plain authenticated user can do MUST be justified per
  Principle V, not treated as free because "there's no RBAC yet anyway." *Mitigated (Phase 1
  Milestone 2)*: the repository's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission is read-only
  (`contents: read`); only the CodeQL job is granted the additional `security-events: write` it
  needs, and only for itself. The merge-gate ruleset on `main` has no bypass actors — no one,
  including repository admins, can merge or push around a failing or missing required check.
  *No widening (Phase 2 Milestone 1)*: the batch endpoint is in the same trust tier as the
  single-record element endpoints and can do nothing they cannot, and it cannot reach across threat models:
  an operation on an element of another model is the same as one on a missing element.
  *No widening (Phase 2 Milestone 3)*: the generate endpoint is in the same trust tier as the single-record
  threat endpoints. Any authenticated account could already create threats and mitigations by hand; generation
  creates only what the shipped, reviewed rules describe, and it gives a client less power over a generated
  threat than over a manual one (its element and rule cannot be changed).

Any change that adds an endpoint, a new external integration, or a new credential type MUST add
or update a bullet above in the same PR, whether or not the surrounding phase has been reached.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

Every pull request MUST state, or make evident from the diff, how it satisfies Principles I–VI.
The active test suite MUST pass before a PR is merged: typecheck, lint, test (with a Postgres
service container, and including the Playwright browser tests against the built app), and Docker
build are enforced as required checks on every PR to `main`, with
Dependabot and CodeQL enabled alongside them (informational, not merge-blocking, in this
milestone). A PR that touches authentication, configuration/secrets handling, any
route's authorization/validation logic, or (from Phase 3) prompt construction, LLM provider
adapters, or document-ingestion code MUST call out the security implication explicitly in its
description and MUST update the Threat Model section if it changes an entry point, asset, or
trust boundary. From Phase 3 onward, a PR that changes a prompt, provider adapter, or the
extraction/threat-generation pipeline MUST include the eval harness results against the
committed thresholds. Reviewers MUST reject PRs that reintroduce a mitigated risk from the
Threat Model (e.g. reverting to string-built SQL, removing the dummy-hash timing defense,
persisting unvalidated LLM output) without an equally strong replacement, and MUST reject PRs
that implement a later phase's scope while an earlier phase is still in progress, per Principle
III.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes any conflicting informal practice for this repository, across all
phases of `plan.md`. Amendments are made by editing this file directly, updating the Sync Impact
Report at its top, and bumping `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` per semantic versioning: MAJOR for
backward-incompatible principle removals or redefinitions, MINOR for a new principle or
materially expanded guidance, PATCH for wording/clarity fixes with no rule change. An amendment
is expected at or near each phase boundary in `plan.md`, since a new phase typically introduces
a new tool, asset, or trust boundary that this file's concrete details (file paths, tool names,
thresholds) should track — updating those details to match the current phase is itself normally
a PATCH or MINOR change, not evidence the principle was wrong. Every PR is expected to be
reviewable against these principles; unavoidable complexity or a deliberate exception (e.g.
broadening a permission before role-based access exists) MUST be justified in the PR description
rather than silently merged. This file is the source of truth for "why" a rule exists —
implementation-level how-to guidance belongs in `README.md`, `API.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `plan.md`, and code
comments, not here.
