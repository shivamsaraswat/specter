## Summary

<!-- What changed and why, in a few bullets. Link the issue (`Closes #123`) or the spec (`specs/phase-N/milestone-M-name/`). -->

## How this satisfies Principles I–VI

See the [constitution](https://github.com/shivamsaraswat/specter/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md) for what each principle requires.

<!-- One row per principle of the constitution (.specify/memory/constitution.md). "N/A" is fine, with a reason. -->

| Principle | How |
|---|---|
| **I. Secure coding** | |
| **II. Test-first** | |
| **III. Simplicity** | |
| **IV. Maintainability** | |
| **V. Least privilege / Threat Model** | |
| **VI. AI output is a draft** | |

## Security implications

<!-- A new or changed entry point, authentication, input validation, secrets or permissions? Describe
     each, including anything this broadens. Write "None" if there are none. -->

## Threat Model

<!-- Updated: which section of the constitution's Threat Model changed. Or "No change", and why
     (the change adds no asset, entry point or trust boundary). -->

## Testing

<!-- The tests you wrote first, and what they cover. Which of these you ran locally:
     pnpm typecheck, pnpm lint, pnpm test, pnpm test:e2e, docker build . -->

<!-- Threat rules: if this changes `packages/threat-library/rules/`, did an existing rule's
     `element_type`, `category` or `when` change? If so, retire it and add a new rule under a new id
     instead (spec FR-021). Did any line disappear from `rules/ids.yaml`? None may (FR-019a). The
     checks cannot see either, so review enforces both. Write "N/A" if rules are untouched. -->
